# @codewhale/runtime-sdk

Small JavaScript helpers and TypeScript declarations for Codewhale's local
Runtime API. The package is intentionally transport-only: it never bypasses the
Rust runtime, sandbox, approvals, provider configuration, or Runtime execution
ledger.

```js
import { createRuntimeClient } from "@codewhale/runtime-sdk";

const client = createRuntimeClient({
  baseUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:7878",
  token: process.env.CODEWHALE_RUNTIME_TOKEN,
});

const created = await client.createFleetRun({
  target: "this_computer",
  roles: [{ name: "reviewer" }, { name: "verifier" }],
  workflow: {
    id: "release-check",
    kind: "parallel",
    tasks: [
      { id: "review", name: "Review", instructions: "Review locally.", worker: { role: "reviewer" } },
      { id: "verify", name: "Verify", instructions: "Verify locally.", worker: { role: "verifier" } },
    ],
  },
});

// Creation is durable but does not launch work. Launch remains explicit.
await client.startFleetRun(created.run.id);

let cursor;
for await (const event of client.fleetEvents(created.run.id, { after: cursor })) {
  if (event.cursor) cursor = event.cursor; // persist durable cursors only
  if (event.event === "fleet.replay.cursor_unavailable") {
    // Reload getFleetRun(created.run.id), then reconnect without the old cursor.
  }
}
```

## Fleet Helpers

- `listFleetRuns()`
- `getFleetRun(runId)`
- `listFleetWorkers(runId)`
- `getFleetWorker(workerId)`
- `interruptWorker(workerId)`
- `stopWorker(workerId)`
- `restartWorker(workerId)`
- `stopFleetRun(runId)`
- `startFleetRun(runId)`
- `replayFleetEvents(runId, { after, limit })`
- `fleetEvents(runId, { after, limit })`
- `createFleetRun(spec)`

The v0.9.11 Runtime implements the complete local managed-Fleet path. Fleet
names the roster and selected member; the Runtime owns launch authority,
durable run/worker/event state, replay, and execution. A creation request must
name its roles, define a `parallel` Workflow, and select the explicit
`this_computer` target. `another_computer` and `cloud` are contract values but
fail closed until those targets are implemented. Event cursors are opaque and
durable across Runtime restarts; if Runtime ledger compaction removes an old
cursor, replay returns a conflict so the client can reload the run projection.
Local worker IDs are generated per run; managed creation does not yet accept
caller-assigned `worker_specs` because worker controls address IDs globally.

Older runtimes that do not expose one of these endpoints produce a
`RuntimeCapabilityError` with a stable capability string instead of a generic
fetch failure.

## Read a thread journal

`threadEvents(threadId, { sinceSeq, replayLimit, signal })` reads the existing
`GET /v1/threads/{id}/events` SSE endpoint. It never creates a thread or starts
a turn. Pass an `AbortSignal` to close the subscription. Redirects are refused,
and incomplete or oversized frames fail instead of producing partial records.

The returned `seq` and `previous_seq` belong to Runtime. Keep the last accepted
`seq` for reconnects; sequence numbers need not be consecutive. Consumers should
validate the selected thread and predecessor cursor before advancing their own
read position. Authentication uses the client constructor's existing `token`
option and stays in the Authorization header.


Consumers that present **current** activity can pass `includeProgress: true`.
The same endpoint adds `progress=true` and advertises support with
`x-codewhale-event-progress: 1`. A Runtime without that capability fails
explicitly; a historical event is not a readiness signal.

Opt-in streams include `{ event: "stream.progress", thread_id, seq, state }`,
where `state` is `replaying` or `live`. These are transport frames at the existing
journal cursor, not journal events or new sequence numbers. Initial replay and
broadcast-lag recovery are `replaying`. The stream becomes `live` only after
both durable history and the already queued live tail have been drained. A
request answered during replay therefore settles before readiness is reported.
Later lag can return the same connection to `replaying`. Consumers should stop
extending activity while replaying or disconnected and validate the thread and
cursor. Default streams retain the original event-only contract.
