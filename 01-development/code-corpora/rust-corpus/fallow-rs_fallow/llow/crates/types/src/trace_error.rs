//! Stack-trace frame resolution contract for `fallow trace-error`.
//!
//! The verb answers one narrow question: for each frame of a runtime stack
//! trace, which definitions in the analysed project does that frame's
//! identifier name? It is deliberately easy to overclaim here, so the wire
//! shape is built so that it cannot:
//!
//! - a frame that matches several definitions reports `ambiguous` and lists
//!   every candidate, instead of picking one and calling it the answer;
//! - a frame that matches nothing reports `not_found` instead of being dropped;
//! - a frame that matches one definition but whose own line sits at a
//!   different declaration carries `line_mismatch`, because the look-up asks
//!   about the identifier and not about the line;
//! - a frame the project graph was never asked about (a dependency frame, a
//!   runtime-internal frame, a generated bundle, or a frame carrying no
//!   identifier to look up) reports `not_attempted` rather than borrowing
//!   `not_found`'s meaning;
//! - every frame read from the input appears in `frames`, in input order, and
//!   [`ErrorTraceCounts`](crate::trace_error::ErrorTraceCounts) publishes the
//!   per-outcome totals, so a caller can see exactly how much of its trace
//!   went unanswered.
//!
//! No source-map resolution is performed. A frame pointing into a build
//! artifact is reported as such, because a stale map rebinds silently to the
//! wrong line and a wrong line is worse than an honest refusal.
