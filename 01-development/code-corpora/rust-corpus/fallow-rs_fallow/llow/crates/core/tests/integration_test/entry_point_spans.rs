//! Attribution gate for the entry-point discovery stage.
//!
//! `PipelineTimings::entry_points_ms` used to be a single opaque number, so a
//! slow discovery stage could only be guessed at. These tests assert that the
//! sub-spans are a real partition of that stage: every span is an elapsed time
//! rather than a difference, together they never exceed the stage they
//! subdivide, and a section that did not run does not absorb the work of the
//! section next to it.
//!
//! None of these assertions is a duration threshold. A span's magnitude is a
//! property of the machine, so the invariants here are shape (non-negative,
//! contained in the parent stage) and relative attribution (a skipped section
//! against a sibling that provably did filesystem work in the same run).
