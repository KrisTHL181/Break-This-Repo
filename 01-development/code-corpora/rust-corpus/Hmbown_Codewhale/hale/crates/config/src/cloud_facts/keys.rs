//! Keys are pinned in the binary. The Supabase `facts_key` table and the
//! website mirror (`web/lib/cloud-facts/keys.ts`) are informational; a facts
//! envelope is accepted only when its signature verifies under an `Active` key
//! listed here. `web/scripts/check-cloud-facts.mjs` fails CI if this table and
//! the TypeScript mirror diverge.
//!
//! Rotation (two-release rule): pin the new key here → ship → sign with both
//! keys (`sigs`) → mark the old key `Retired` → ship → drop it. Compromise:
//! revoke every release signed by the key server-side, ship a binary without
//! the key. There is deliberately no in-band "distrust this key" message.
