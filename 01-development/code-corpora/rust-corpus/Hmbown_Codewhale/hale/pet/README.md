# Codewhale: a whale living in code

The current live experience is [one durable pet with attached views](SHARED.md):
Ratatui Watch/full habitat, browser, native companion and mobile Shared modes.
That guide contains build/run commands, source selection and the ownership
contract. The standalone demos and file studies described below stay isolated.


The dots are Codewhale's material. The whale is its recognizable home form;
real activity can reorganize that material into a living expression of the work.
This is an evolving audiovisual instrument, not a mascot that asks for attention.

The current implementation has a persistent 980-particle world, thirteen event
categories, deterministic audio, replay and checkpoints. Version 2 reorganizes
the same particles into knots for reasoning, woven strands for code, branches for
filesystem activity, scanning layers for browsing, and circulating paths for
network traffic. Human input opens a junction in the field. It does not steer
the creature toward its owner. The whale re-forms as activity settles.
These are authored expressions of measured activity, not generated pictures of
arbitrary task content. Missing telemetry stays visibly unknown.

## Build from this repository

Requires Node 22.13 or later and Python 3 for the local static server.
No sibling repository, investor folder, credentials or provider call is needed.

```sh
npm --prefix pet ci --ignore-scripts
npm --prefix pet run check
npm --prefix pet start
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:4632/pet.html>. Wild is a simulated creature; Event demo
is synthetic telemetry. Import trace / tape accepts event-v1, OTLP, existing
Codewhale session/Runtime journals and saved pet recordings. Sound requires an
explicit gesture. Still preserves a static semantic pose. Follow local tape
uses the browser's File System Access API; other browsers support import/export.

```sh
# Regenerate embedded QuickJS and Apple bundles from the same source.
npm --prefix pet run sync
# Full product terminal; use /pet and /pet export.
cargo build --locked -p codewhale-tui --bin codewhale-tui
# Small standalone braille renderer, without the full product link.
cargo fetch --locked --manifest-path pet/tui/Cargo.toml
cd pet
./verify.sh --no-swift
```

`./verify.sh` without the flag additionally requires Swift and compares all
three ports. The script fails for a missing tool or failed build; it does not
silently call an omitted platform verified. See [QA.md](QA.md) for native builds.

The [Android application](android/README.md) builds with its Gradle wrapper and
JDK 17. Compose, native audio, checkpoint import/export and lifecycle behavior
are exercised on an Android 15 emulator; CI uploads the debug APK and test reports.

In the full terminal, `/pet sound on` enables the shared score and
`/pet sound off` mutes it. Sound starts off each time the application
opens. Install FFmpeg with `ffplay` on PATH to use this optional output; Watch
and recording work without it. The terminal streams the core's stereo 48 kHz
PCM to one player process. Hiding Watch, opening a modal, quiet mode, or stale
telemetry presentation suspends output. Reopening starts at the current clock,
without playing the intervening history. Player failure mutes sound and reports
a warning while the world continues. `/pet sound` shows its status.

## One source of meaning

`src/core/pet-telemetry.ts` derives 400 ms buckets from normalized Whalesong
event-v1. Measured span occupancy selects the channel; onset counts, repeat
density, error receipts, human requests and agent identities carry other facts.
Container spans are excluded. Open-ended spans without observation coverage,
disconnects and missing intervals are unknown, not successful idle time.

`pet-world.ts` advances a 30 Hz creature clock and named seeded random streams.
It journals accepted telemetry, interactions, behaviors and persistent pod slots.
`pet-audio.ts` schedules voices from that same clock. Noise uses absolute sample
positions, so buffer partitioning cannot change the score. Audio mixing is a
host concern. `pet-native.ts` exposes this exact core to QuickJS/JavaScriptCore.
The TUI, Apple and Android hosts do not carry their own event bucketers or score schedulers.
Apple copies validated Float32 PCM channels directly from JavaScriptCore into
native buffers; it does not serialize sample arrays as JSON. AVAudioEngine
follows the world clock, rebases presentation after a stall, and discards stale
voices after a long gap. Device or rendering failures mute sound and report a
message while the world, persistence and export continue.

The Rust particle implementation lives in the product's
`crates/tui/src/tui/ambient_life/pet_sim.rs`; this package's runner imports it.
Swift and Kotlin particle ports must match its conformance digests. Generated
native bundles are committed so the product Rust build needs no Node compiler.
Run `npm run sync` after changing core source; the generated-byte check in CI
rejects a stale bundle. Local Whalesong consumers use aliases to these same
canonical files, not separately maintained source copies.

The original Whalesong importer, signal model, schema and browser storage code
are included because they are actual dependencies of the pet. Their original
Apache-2.0 [license](LICENSE) and [notice](NOTICE) are retained. Rust files imported
from the product retain that repository's license.

## Live recording

The adapter only reads the existing Runtime journal endpoint
`GET /v1/threads/{id}/events`. It never starts a turn.

```sh
cd pet
node scripts/pet.mjs --runtime=http://127.0.0.1:7878 --thread=THREAD_ID --output=pet.jsonl
node scripts/pet.mjs --input=trace.jsonl --output=other.pet.jsonl --watch
# Restart an existing live recording at the same path:
node scripts/pet.mjs --runtime=http://127.0.0.1:7878 --thread=THREAD_ID --output=pet.jsonl --resume
node scripts/pet.mjs --demo --output=demo.pet.jsonl
```

Choose an existing thread and an unused output path, or use `--resume` to restart
a stopped live recorder at its existing path. Optional authentication
comes from `CODEWHALE_RUNTIME_TOKEN`; tokens are rejected in URLs. Only plain
HTTP loopback IP origins are accepted. Redirects, invalid envelopes and cursor
holes are rejected; reconnects resume from the last accepted Runtime cursor.
The recorder requests the Runtime stream's opt-in replay-progress capability.
It remains unknown until durable replay and the queued live tail have drained;
receiving the first historical event does not make it current. Broadcast-lag
recovery returns the stream to replaying. Older Runtime/SDK combinations without
this capability stop input explicitly and leave the recording unobserved; use
the Runtime built from this source alongside the recorder.
The recorder seals the preceding observation interval against a fixed clock.
It retains request lifetimes and counts a delayed error once at receipt time.
Raw prompts, arguments, results and tokens do not enter the pet recording.
Live recording continues in segments. At 216,000 buckets (24 hours) or 64 MiB,
the recorder syncs the completed file, preserves it as
`OUTPUT.segment-000001.jsonl` (then `000002`, etc.), and atomically replaces the
same live pathname. Each segment starts at sequence zero and replays independently.
Use `--segment-buckets=N` to rotate sooner. Followers establish a new baseline
after replacement, then accept subsequent appends as current observations.

The live importer retains unfinished lifetimes and 16 seconds of completed
events for the bucketer's recurrence window. It removes raw payloads immediately;
250,000 events and 64 MiB bound retained metadata, not total session history.
Completed output segments remain on disk, so disk use grows with recorded history.
Rotation requires same-directory hard links and atomic replacement. Unsupported
storage, an archive-name collision or an external replacement stops recording
without overwriting the existing files. With `--resume`, the recorder validates
the previous complete tape, preserves its exact bytes in the next numbered
archive, and starts a new segment at the same live path. The first bucket is
unknown; fresh source observations follow. It never invents events or estimates
the duration of an outage from file timestamps. The companion's separately saved
habitat preserves its particles and clock across attachment.

A private, empty `OUTPUT.writer-lock` sidecar uses Node's built-in SQLite OS lock
to exclude simultaneous recorders. Keep this file in place; its lock is released
on close or process death without deleting a stale PID file. It contains no
events. Use local storage with working OS locks, hard links and atomic rename.
Malformed, incomplete, oversized or non-file previous tapes are preserved and
rejected; use a new output path while retaining the original for recovery.
`--resume` applies only to live recording, and can also create an unused path.

The thin wire is JSONL, one flat version-1 `PetBucket` per line: PetState plus
`sequence`, `simTimeMs`, `durationMs`, thirteen-element `onsets` and `activeMs`,
`errors`, `agentIds` and `waiting`. Sequence starts at zero in 400 ms steps.
Saved replay JSON contains this accepted tape and the interaction journal;
a versioned checkpoint also contains particle, random-stream and score cursors.
Recordings also store `expressionVersion`: new worlds use version 2; recordings
without this field retain the original version 1 particle and behavior rules.
Checkpoints must agree with the recording's expression version. Unsupported or
mismatched versions are rejected before changing the current world. This keeps
old saved habitats replayable while letting new worlds change their visual form.
The older TSV is a particle conformance tape and cannot preserve audio onsets.

macOS watches `~/.codewhale/pet-state`. iOS watches `pet-state` in Documents.
Android uses More → Follow file study to select a seekable device document.
The browser's Follow local tape uses a user-granted File System Access handle.
All three file readers use the same shared live cursor: the first complete packet
establishes a baseline, and only an advancing sequence becomes an observation.
Duplicate input, a restarted sequence, or bytes read during suspension cannot
replay an old onset or human request. Missing/invalid input expires to unknown;
resuming advances beyond already accepted input without replaying its sound.
Apple watches appends and directory replacement. Android reads a bounded 256 KiB
tail on an IO worker, closes it on pause/background, and discards delayed delivery.
The file must be updated by a producer; selecting a completed tape does not make
it live. Use Import to replay that tape. Device files are not automatically synced
from the desktop recorder.
The current live chain has been exercised with typed synthetic Engine events
through the actual Runtime journal/SSE endpoint, recorder process and Apple
file watcher/host. The world receives a fresh human request and clears it after
its answer; prompt, question and answer text stay out of the recording. This
uses the existing mock Engine handle without calling a provider. The older
read-only Runtime 0.9.13 receipt predates the required progress capability and
does not establish current compatibility.

## Persistence and current limits

The standalone browser commits checkpoint and recording together with an optimistic
IndexedDB revision. A saved live source reopens as Replay until explicitly
reattached. Legacy TUI `artifacts/pet/habitat.json` files remain recoverable; current Watch attaches to the companion.
Apple hosts keep source-specific files in Application Support/CodewhalePet.
Android keeps separate wild/demo/recording/live habitats in private app storage.
Native writes are private and atomic, use a writer lock and content revision,
and preserve corrupt files or external edits. Recovery is visible in the UI.

Modern checkpoints hydrate without replaying historical simulation. Live resume
starts unknown and drops old human requests. Apple legacy wild preferences
migrate only after a successful checkpoint save. Native autosave is every five
seconds, so a crash may lose work since the last successful save.

New worlds use version 2 recordings with an exact starting checkpoint and
absolute telemetry sequences. After 1,024 consumed buckets or 4,096 applied
inputs, the host saves completed history as an immutable segment before replacing
the active habitat. Only then does the running world retire that history. Its
particles, random streams and score continue without a reset. Gaps remain unknown;
future imported events stay in the active segment. Version 1 imports still work.

Earlier recordings opens saved segments in the browser and exports them on Apple
and Android. TUI segments are JSON files beside `habitat.json` in the session's
`artifacts/pet` directory. Each segment replays independently from its starting
checkpoint; seeking cannot precede that point. Browser source changes archive
the entire outgoing recording, including unplayed imported events. Archived files
are retained, so disk use grows with recorded history even though active history
is bounded.

Native autosaves and native imports are limited to 8 MiB; the QuickJS worker
has a 64 MiB memory limit. All four hosts export recordings in chunks, including
the exact checkpoint, with a 64 MiB file limit. Files over 8 MiB can be recovered
in the browser. Android finishes the export in a private staging file before
opening the user-selected destination. Apple source changes keep the current
visit when saving fails; leaving without saving requires an explicit choice.

A 30-hour synthetic Still run of the shared core rotated 263 segments and kept
the active file below 0.45 MB, with exact checkpoint continuation after every
rotation. Apple and Android separately exercise archive publication, failed saves
and continued execution in their actual embedded engines. This is not 30 hours
of animated native-device or power testing. Current platform builds, replay,
live file delivery and measured audio output have separate receipts in [QA.md](QA.md).
Automatic desktop-to-phone transport is not included: mobile hosts consume a
local file using the shared contract. Physical-phone listening/battery quality
and current macOS popover inspection have not been established. The source is
available as a development build; this branch has not been released.
