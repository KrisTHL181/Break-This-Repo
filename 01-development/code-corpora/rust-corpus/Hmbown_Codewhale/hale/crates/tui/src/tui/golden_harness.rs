//! Shared golden-buffer harness for the Tideline components (spec §5c).
//!
//! Every Tideline component proves itself against cell-exact golden buffers
//! at the four canonical blocker sizes. This module owns the one dump format
//! and the one bless protocol so they cannot drift between components:
//!
//! - rows are the `Buffer` cell symbols in paint order, `width` per row;
//! - rows are joined by `\n` with one trailing newline;
//! - goldens live in `crates/tui/src/tui/goldens/{name}_{w}x{h}.txt`;
//! - a missing golden fails the test unless `CODEWHALE_BLESS_GOLDENS=1` is
//!   set, in which case the rendered text is written as the new contract.
//!
//! Goldens are the design contract — a visual change that cannot show as a
//! golden diff did not happen.

// Ink plane — the colour half of the design contract.
//
// `render_golden_text` dumps cell *symbols*. That is only half a render: a
// screen can go from a gold mark over a blue gradient to uniform grey without
// moving a single glyph, and the symbol golden would not notice. The founder's
// standing complaint about the startup screen ("everything in the same dim
// gray") was, mechanically, invisible to this suite.
//
// The ink plane closes that hole. Each painted cell becomes one character
// keyed to its (fg, bg, modifier) triple, with a legend resolving those keys
// to concrete values, so a contrast change shows up as a golden diff.
